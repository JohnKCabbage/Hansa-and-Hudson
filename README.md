## Mission

- Convert raw data into decision-ready analysis  
- Apply technical tools to real geopolitical and financial problems  
- Demonstrate end-to-end analytical capability  
- Produce operationally relevant research  

## Core Analytical Focus

### Military Power & Force Employment

- Translating defense budgets into **deployable combat capability** through cross-national cost, readiness, and procurement efficiency analysis  
- Modeling **force structure sustainability under high-intensity conflict conditions**, including munitions expenditure, replacement rates, and industrial surge capacity  
- Assessing **modernization timelines vs. threat pacing** using program-level acquisition and production data  

### Defense Industrial Base & Economic Mobilization

- Mapping **shipbuilding, aerospace, and precision-guided munitions production capacity** across major powers  
- Identifying **supply chain bottlenecks and single-point failures** in strategic defense manufacturing  
- Evaluating **war-time reconstitution potential** through labor, capital intensity, and throughput constraints  

### Geoeconomic Competition & Strategic Dependency

- Quantifying **trade and resource dependencies that create coercive leverage in crisis or conflict**  
- Modeling the **economic impact of sanctions, blockades, and maritime interdiction** on states
- Analyzing **critical energy, mineral, and technology flows** as instruments of national power  

### Financial Markets as Forward Indicators

- Using **rates, credit conditions, and sector rotation** to track defense spending cycles and industrial policy shifts  
- Identifying **market-implied expectations of conflict, mobilization, and strategic realignment**  
- Linking **sovereign balance sheets to military sustainability and procurement capacity**  

### Macroeconomics of Great-Power Competition

- Assessing **long-cycle fiscal and demographic constraints on military expansion**  
- Comparing **economic structures for their ability to support prolonged conflict**  
- Tracking **capital allocation into strategic industries** as a measure of national prioritization
